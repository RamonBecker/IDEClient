# IDEClient

> This project is a prototype of an IDE. This project is also a client, and the server is in a separate repository.
 
## :information_source: Information 

The application simulates the creation of a project in Java. The structure of a project in the application consists of: packages and classes. The packages store the classes. And the classes are the code that the user can write. The execution of classes was also predetermined, such as the hello world that is executed. All client communication is carried out by socket, where the client communicates with the server to send and receive updated data. The server can be found: https://github.com/RamonBecker/IDEServer. A test project has been created in the application. In this project the user can register, list, edit and delete a company. In the project, the user can register an emergency occurrence and then list it. The project name is like my test project.
